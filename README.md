Assignment Details:

You will be asked to create a short user-focused documentation piece on a Web3 topic, specifically comparing optimistic rollups vs. ZK rollups. The task is to write an accessible guide or article that covers the following:
• Explanation of Concepts: Clearly define what optimistic rollups and ZK (zero-knowledge) rollups are, in your own words. Assume the reader has basic blockchain knowledge but is not an expert.
• Key Differences: Describe the differences between the two approaches (how they work, security models, performance, etc.) in a concise and understandable manner. Highlight the pros and cons or appropriate use-cases of each, in a way that would help a user or developer decide which to use.
• Accessible Language: Use a tone that is friendly and professional. Avoid unnecessary jargon – if you must use technical terms, briefly explain them. The goal is to make the content understandable to non-experts while still providing value to technical readers.
• Structure and Clarity: Organize the document with clear headings, subheadings, or bullet points so that it’s easy to scan. For example, you might include an introduction, a section for each type of rollup, a comparison section, and a conclusion or summary. You can also include a short step-by-step example or analogy if it helps illustrate the concepts.

Expected Deliverable:
A written document or markdown file (approximately 2-3 pages, or about 800-1200 words) that fulfills the above requirements. The content should be polished as if it were going directly into our user documentation. We will be looking at how well you explain the topic, the clarity of your writing, the accuracy of information, and how you structure the guide. This assignment is meant to showcase your ability to educate users on complex Web3 topics in a clear and concise way.
