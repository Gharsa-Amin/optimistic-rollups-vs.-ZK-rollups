## Introduction

As Ethereum continues to grow, scalability has become a major concern. To address this, **Layer 2 scaling solutions** like **Rollups** have been introduced to improve transaction throughput without compromising the security of the Ethereum network. There are two main types of rollups: **Optimistic Rollups** and **ZK Rollups**. 

This guide aims to provide a clear and concise comparison of these two technologies, helping you make an informed decision on which is best suited for your needs.

## Key Differences Between Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups

| **Aspect**               | **Optimistic Rollups**                                       | **ZK Rollups**                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transaction Validation**| Assumes transactions are valid and uses fraud proofs.        | Uses cryptographic proofs (ZK-SNARKs) to validate transactions. |
| **Finality**              | Transaction finality occurs after a challenge period.        | Immediate finality due to instant transaction validation.     |
| **Security**              | Relies on fraud proofs; less secure than ZK Rollups.         | High security ensured by cryptographic proofs.               |
| **Performance**           | May experience delays due to fraud-proof challenges.         | Faster due to immediate validation of transactions.          |
| **Complexity**            | Easier to implement, but may result in slower finality.      | More complex to implement due to cryptographic proofs.       |
| **Use Case**              | Better for applications where simplicity and cost-effectiveness are more important. | Ideal for applications that prioritize security and fast finality. |
